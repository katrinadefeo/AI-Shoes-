# AI-Shoes-

These shoes do not exist! They were made using AI.

Tools I used for this project were:

Midjourney: Artwork AI
ChatGPT: Used for words on the webpage. For example, the shoe description was made only using ChatGPT
Figma: For actually designing the web page 

I am confident that AI is a tool that can make our lives easier and is not something people and oragnaizations should be afraid of. 
I personally expect to be using it more in my personal life. Feel free to ask me any questions on how I did it. 
This is my first ever AI project, and I am very happy with the results!
