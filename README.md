# AI-Shoes-

These shoes do not exist! They were made using AI.

Tools I used for this project were:

-Midjourney: Artwork AI (Having Discord downloaded is a requirement)

-ChatGPT: Used for words on the webpage. For example, the shoe description was made only using ChatGPT

-Figma: For actually designing the web page 


All these tools are free to use but there are limitations, so please be aware of that.

I am confident that AI is a tool that can make our lives easier and is not something people and organizations should be afraid of. We just have to remember that it is a tool to HELP us, not to think for us. 
I personally expect to be using it more in my personal life. Feel free to ask me any questions on how I did it. 
This is my first-ever AI project, and I am very happy with the results!
